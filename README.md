I did this project a while back. Basically, it is a wearable device that children wear and it keeps track of various factors of the environment that surrounds them. The first iteration only had a water sensor to see if the child fell into a pool or some body of water. Later iterations included a proximity sensor and a heat sensor in case the child got too far away from the parents' phone or got too close to a flame or heat source (stove, microwave).

Images includes pictures of the circuit with an on-PCB heat sensor and a water sensor.

BabySaverApp has files for the accompanying Android application.

The other folders contain various code iterations used in this device's development.

CAD Files contains all the CAD desgins for an encasement I made for a later iteration of the device. Unfortunatley, I was not able to print it out and fully develop the final device iteration :(
